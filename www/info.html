Data for MGV have been obtained from the following resources:
<ul>
<li> Genome assemblies for 19 mouse strains from ENSEMBL. All strain assemblies are "v1" except for C57BL/6J, for which both GRCm38 and GRCm39 are included. 
<li> Gene models for 18 mouse strains from ENSEMBL release 108.
<li> Gene models for C57BL/6J from MGI. GRCm38 models are from 4 Jan 2021; GRCm39 models are current with MGI.
<li> Genome assemblies for non-mouse genomes from NCBI: human (GRCh38), rat (Rnor_6.0), frog (UCB_Xtro_10.0 and GCA_017654675.1_Xenopus_laevis_v10.1), zebrafish (GRCz11), fly (BDGP6.32), worm (WBcel235), yeast (R64-1-1)
<li> Gene models for non-mouse genomes (except frog) from the Alliance for Genome Resources release 5.4.0.
<li> Gene models for Xenopus tropicalis and Xenopur laevis from Xenbase.
<li> Orthology assertions from the Alliance for Genome Resources release 5.4.0, strict orthology set.
