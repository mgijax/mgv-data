Data for MGV have been obtained from the following resources:
<ul>
<li> Genome assemblies for 19 mouse strains from ENSEMBL. All strain assemblies are "v1" except for C57BL/6J, for which both GRCm38 and GRCm39 are included. 
<li> Gene models for 18 mouse strains from ENSEMBL release 103.
<li> Gene models for C57BL/6J from MGI. GRCm38 models are from 4 Jan 2021; GRCm39 models are current with MGI.
<li> Genome assemblies for non-mouse genomes from NCBI: GRCh38, Rnor_6.0, GRCz11, BDGP6.32, WBcel235, R64-1-1
<li> Gene models for non-mouse genomes from the Alliance for Genome Resources release 4.0.0.
